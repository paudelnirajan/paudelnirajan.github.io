## My Learning Path

I'm currently diving deep into the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Here are some key areas I'm focusing on:

### Current Learning Topics

- **Machine Learning algorithms** - Understanding the fundamentals of supervised and unsupervised learning
- **Natural Language Processing** - Working with text data and language models
- **Web development with Jekyll** - Building this static site and learning modern web technologies

### Technical Skills I'm Developing

I'm getting hands-on experience with:
- Python ecosystem (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Data visualization and analysis tools
- Version control with Git and GitHub

### My Goals for the Future

I want to explore more about **AI ethics** and **responsible AI development**. As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, it's crucial to consider:

- How AI affects different communities and cultures
- Ensuring fair and unbiased algorithms
- Privacy and security implications
- The environmental impact of large AI models

### Projects I'm Working On

I'm particularly interested in:
